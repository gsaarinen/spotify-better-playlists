# Spotify-Better-Playlists

This app is a simple reimagining of the UI for playlists in Spotify.It is essentially a prototype but gave me an excuse to explore more with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In order to run locally you will need the following:
- A Spotify Developer Account
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- A clone of [this repo](https://github.com/mpj/oauth-bridge-template) to run your backend. Follow the README instructions there

A backend server is run for security as to not expose your Secret and ID.

## To Run:

- `cd` into the backend directory clone
- run `npm start`
- open a second bash session
- `cd` into the Better-Playlists directory
- run `npm start`
- got to `http://localhost:8888/login`
